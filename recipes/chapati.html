    <h1>Soft Chapati</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>WHAT IS CHAPATI?</strong>
        Chapati (also known as chapatti, chapathi or chappathi) is an
        unleavened flatbread normally made using all-purpose wheat flour,
        water, salt and oil. East African chapati, which is especially
        popular in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, is larger in diameter and is
        normally referred to as roti in India. Chapatis have their origins
        in the Indian subcontinent and were introduced to the rest of the
        world by immigrants, especially Indian merchants.

    <h2 id="chapati_ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>5 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon salt</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</ul>
    <ul>2¾ cups water</ul>
    <ul>6 tablespoon ghee or cooking oil (to add to the flour, and to
        smoothen the dough)</ul>
    <ul>½ cup ghee or cooking oil (to knead as well as fry the chapati)</ul>

    <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>

    <li>Mix the dry ingredients, namely all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar
        in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons oil or ghee to the flour mixture
        and combine. Next, add the water, a little at a time, and use your
        fists or an electric mixer to knead for about 10 minutes until you
        obtain a soft and smooth dough. Feel free to add some flour in small
        handfuls, if the dough feels too sticky.</li>

    <li>Add another 3 tablespoons of oil or ghee to the dough and knead some
        more, for about two minutes (you will use the rest of the oil to
        cook). The dough should now feel soft and pliable, and should no
        longer stick to the fingers.</li>

    <li>Cover the dough with a clean and damp kitchen cloth or plastic wrap
        and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>

    <li>Divide the dough into 10 equally-sized balls. Dust a wooden pastry
        board or your kitchen counter with flour, lightly sprinkle some
        flour on top of each ball of dough, and use a rolling pin to roll
        each into a circle of 20cm in diameter (about 8 inches). If the
        dough resists stretching, let it relax for a while and then roll
        again. Feel free to dust with more flour, if the dough sticks to the
        rolling board.</li>

    <li>Brush each chapati with a little melted ghee or cooking oil, lightly
        sprinkle some flour on top and roll it so it resembles a rope (skip
        this step for plain chapatis - see the notes below). Next, coil the
        rope towards the centre, and tuck the end in the middle.</li>

    <li>Cover the coiled balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel and allow
        this to rest for 10 minutes. Next, lightly dust your kitchen counter
        or wooden pastry board with flour again. Roll out each ball of dough
        into a circle of 20cm (about 8 inches) in diameter and 3mm (about
        ⅛th inch) in thickness. Feel free to lightly dust with flour, so it
        rolls out easily.</li>

    <li>Bring a non-stick or heavy-bottomed pan to high heat. Once hot,
        reduce the heat to a medium and place the rolled chapati dough on
        top. Cook each side until brown spots form and the chapati starts to
        puff up then use a spoon to flip.</li>

    <li>Lightly brush the cooked surface with melted ghee, allow the bottom
        to also brown and puff up, flip and allow the oiled side to cook for
        one to two minutes. Lightly brush the other side with ghee or
        cooking oil as well and allow it to cook for a minute or two, or
        until the desired level of brown has been obtained.</li>

    <li>Serve chapati with tea or your favourite stews, curries, or grilled
        dishes.</li>
    <h2>**NOTES</h2>
    <li>Get the temperature right - heat your pan under high heat before you
        place the chapati on top. Once you start cooking, reduce the heat to
        medium and keep alternating between medium and low heat. Cook at too
        high a temperature and they will brown before they are cooked on the
        inside. Similarly, if the temperature is too low then they just
        harden up.</li>

    <li>Soft and layered chapati - Lukewarm water works best. If you choose
        to use cold water, then make sure to rest the dough for at least 30
        minutes. Also, you can add a cup of buttermilk (maziwa mala) to your
        chapati. The acid in buttermilk helps relax the gluten, resulting in
        softer chapatis. Chapatis get their layers from the oil added once
        the dough has been rolled out before cooking, so I highly recommend
        that you do not skip this step if you want them flaky.</li>

    <h2>Substitutions</h2>

    <li>Use whole wheat or ''Atta flour'' for more fibre.</li>

    <li>Knead the dough using milk or plant milk, instead of water.</li>

    <li>Use butter, ghee or any cooking oil with a high smoking point such

        as sunflower or corn oil. Avoid oils with low smoking points such as
        olive oil as these will dry your chapati</li>
