  <h1>Swahili pilau rice with meat</h1>
  <p>
    Pilau rice is one of the most frequent unique dishes to be found in
    Kenya's restaurants, especially on the coast. The recipe is of Middle
    Eastern origin, but its Swahili variant is mainly widespread in Kenya and
    Tanzania and its fame has also reached South Africa and Ethiopia. Unlike
    the Indian one, it does not have curry and is less spicy, but spicy than
    the Arab one. Here is the recipe.

    Fry the ginger and garlic in a pan with a drop of oil, add the meat and a
    glass of water.
  </li>
  <li>Soften the meat until it is beautiful and tender.</li>
  <li>
    In another pot, put about 4 tablespoons of oil and add the onions, fry
    them until they begin to soften, then add all the spices and potatoes and
    cook for a few minutes. Add water and salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the potatoes are almost ready, add the meat with its stock and finish
    cooking.
  </li>
  <li>Add the rice and cook until it is almost tender.</li>
  <li>
    If the rice is soft and you have excess water you can drain it, or if you
    have less water and the rice is not yet tender you can add more water and
    continue cooking

  <li>
    For an excellent yield, pour everything into the oven for 20 minutes at
    300 degrees.
