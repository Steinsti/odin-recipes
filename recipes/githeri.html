        <h1>Githeri</h1>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s made by members of the Kikuyu tribe, who are known for this
            dish and
            typically use red beans in their githeri recipes. Green mung beans
            or
            black-eyed peas, on the other hand, may be used in githeri prepared
            by
            different tribal communities in Kenya.

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>

        <li>Boil the corn and Kidney beans in a pot until soft</li>

        <li>In a large pan, add olive oil over medium heat. Once heated, saute
            onions for a couple of minutes until lightly
            golden and translucent in appearance</li>

        <li>Stir in garlic, smoked paprika and curry powder. Cook on low heat
            while stirring for a minute</li>

        <li>Now, add tomatoes; cook for three minutes or until the tomatoes are
            soft and mushy</li>

        <li>Next, stir in beans, corn kernels, stock and salt; cover the githeri
            mixture and reduce heat to low-medium. Simmer for about
            8 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>

        <li>Garnish githeri with spring onion (scallion) and cilantro</li>

        <h2>**NOTES</h2>
        <li>Use fleshy and extremely ripe tomatoes as they cook quicker.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigeration and freezing</strong> - store cooked Githeri
            in a suitable
            airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days and in the freezer
            for up to 12 months. Kept in a cool kitchen, it can be kept on the
            countertop for a day.</li>
